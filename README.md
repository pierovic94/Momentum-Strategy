# Momentum-Strategy

I build a scorecard where you can find/screen good momentum stocks on Russel 2000 Index.
To construct the scorecard, I used variables that are common to momentum stocks (like high past returns and Adjusted Earning Surprise). This will allow to rank quantitatively stocks according to their technical/fundamental analysis.

Next, I dig into the company’s businesses and make a qualitative analysis to filter companies that I don’t consider as a good investment.
In order to do so, I used the supervised machine learning algorithm by Bloomberg on the perception of past 8h sentiment news.
In case I found any of my initial quantitative picks to be unfit from a qualitative perspective, I replaced it with the immediate alternative after that.

I present the top growth picks by preference (10 top picks).
